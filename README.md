This is a simple Flappy Bird clone built using Java and Swing for a mini project. It includes a bird, background, and pipes with basic 2D graphics. 
The game uses a real-time loop with a timer and updates the screen using paintComponent(). Itâ€™s a great starting point for learning Java game development.
